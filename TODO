+ In fpl.py, in order to be able to benchmark/test the quality of different prediction strategies for past/finished gameweeks, I should add an option that only considers relevant data up to that point in time!
+ Thoroughly test (1)
+ Revise the nomenclature of ^fplAdv*xPts, ^defAdv*xPts, ^attAdv*xPts, ^avgAdv*xPts,
+ Add the total references to selected_teams.txt (example: Total ^fplAdv*xPts: 100.27200)
- While simulating a particular gameweek (refGW) in the future, i should consider data up to the most recent GW, which is nxtGW-1!
- Teams' stats, just like players' stats, should be based on the med (median) instead of the avg (average = mean) bcoz the med is more reliable/robust than the avg (med is immune to outliers while mean isn't)!!!
print(teams_fixturesPts_dict) gives:

}
for example, ARS pts from GW1 to GW9: 70, 68, 28, 63, 36, etc...
I need to create another section dedicated to the teams stats if necessary... if not...
- When calculating players' xPts(fplAdv), xPts(defAdv), xPts(attAdv), and xPts(avgAdv), try to rewrite the code to avoid redundancies! That will also make the code more readable and less prone to errors!!!
+ fpl_pts/match --> fpl_avg_pts/match --> replace it with fpl_med_pts/match
+ Do the above for def_pts/match and att_pts/match
- I have to review the whole output of fpl.py and see if i need to do some corrections to fpl.py!
- Review the terminology of vars having _avg_
