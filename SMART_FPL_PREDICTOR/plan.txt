Creating a "SMART FPL Predictor" using AI involves several steps and requires a good understanding of machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and possibly deep learning if you want to use neural networks. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect historical data on players, teams, fixtures, and match statistics. This data can include player performance metrics (goals, assists, clean sheets, minutes played, etc.), team performance, and match outcomes.
   - You may also want to collect additional data that could influence player performance, such as weather conditions, player injuries, and transfers.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and errors.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical data to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's predictions.
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features that could help the model make better predictions. For example, you could calculate a player's average points per game over the last few matches to capture their current form.
   - Consider temporal features that take into account the sequence of matches, such as time series analysis or using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate machine learning models. You might start with simpler models like linear regression or random forests and move on to more complex models like gradient boosting machines or neural networks.
   - For a deep learning approach, you could use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial pattern recognition (e.g., player positions) or RNNs/LSTMs for temporal patterns (e.g., player performance over time).

5. **Training and Validation**:
   - Split your data into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Train your model on the training set and tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
   - Validate the model on the validation set to check for overfitting and to ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the model's performance, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or a custom metric that aligns with FPL scoring rules.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Once you have a model that performs well, you can deploy it to make predictions for upcoming gameweeks.
   - You can create a user interface or an API to allow users to interact with the predictor.

8. **Continuous Learning**:
   - As new data becomes available (e.g., after each gameweek), retrain your model to keep it up to date.
   - Consider implementing a feedback loop where the model's predictions are compared with actual outcomes to continuously improve its accuracy.

9. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Explore advanced techniques like ensemble methods, where multiple models are combined to improve predictions.
   - Investigate reinforcement learning, where an agent learns the best actions to take (e.g., player transfers) to maximize a reward (e.g., FPL points).

Remember that creating an AI-based predictor is an iterative process. You'll likely need to go back and refine your steps as you learn more about the data and how your model performs. Additionally, always be mindful of the ethical implications and ensure that your model does not inadvertently introduce bias or unfairness into its predictions.

Creating a full-fledged AI-based FPL predictor is a complex task that involves many steps and cannot be fully encapsulated in a single script, especially in a single response. However, I can provide you with a high-level template that outlines the structure of such a project. You would need to fill in the details for each step based on your specific requirements, data availability, and the machine learning techniques you want to use.

Here's a Python script template that outlines the process:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
import joblib

# Step 1: Data Collection
# Load your historical FPL data
# data = pd.read_csv('fpl_data.csv')

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Define preprocessing steps
# numeric_features = ['goals', 'assists', 'minutes_played', ...]
# categorical_features = ['team', 'position', ...]

# numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
#     ('scaler', StandardScaler())
# ])

# categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
#     ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
# ])

# preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
#     transformers=[
#         ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
#         ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
#     ])

# Step 3: Feature Engineering
# Create new features based on domain knowledge
# data['form'] = ...

# Step 4: Model Selection
# Choose a model or models for prediction
# model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)

# Step 5: Training and Validation
# Split the data into training and validation sets
# X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(data.drop(columns=['target']), data['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a full pipeline with preprocessing and model
# pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
#                            ('model', model)])

# Train the model
# pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Evaluation
# Make predictions on the validation set
# y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_valid)

# Evaluate the model
# mae = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, y_pred)
# print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')

# Step 7: Deployment
# Save the trained model to disk
# joblib.dump(pipeline, 'fpl_predictor_model.joblib')

# Step 8: Continuous Learning
# Implement a system to retrain the model with new data

# Step 9: Advanced Techniques
# Explore advanced techniques and refine the model

# Note: This is a high-level template. Each step needs to be fleshed out with your specific data and requirements.
```

This template provides a starting point, but you'll need to fill in the details for each step. For example, you'll need to collect and preprocess your data, engineer relevant features, select and tune your machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. You may also want to explore more advanced techniques like neural networks or ensemble methods, which would require additional libraries such as TensorFlow or XGBoost.

Remember that this is an iterative process, and you'll likely need to go back and refine your approach as you learn more about the data and how your models perform. It's also important to keep in mind that the success of your predictor will heavily depend on the quality and relevance of the data you use for training.
Creating a "SMART FPL Predictor" from scratch is a complex task that would require a significant amount of code, data, and computational resources. However, I can provide you with a high-level outline of how you might structure such a project in Python, using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and possibly deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch if needed.

Please note that the following is a conceptual outline and not a complete, runnable script.
